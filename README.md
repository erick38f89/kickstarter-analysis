# Kickstarting with Excel

## Crowdfunding analysis for visual productions in order to determine potential success in a current funding attempt.

### The purpose is to assist produce Louise to make an informed decision on how, when and for how much to run a successful crowdfunding campaign for her play Fever.

## Analysis and Challenges
 We analyzed the dataset in Excel filtering the fields that are significant for the play producer. One challenge is to determine the relevant data for the analysis and using examples that are pertinent to the play and the budget that Louise is considering.
 
 We filtered the data using Excel Pivot Tables in order to determine those relevant fields and considerations.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The launch date does not seem to have large impact on the success rate for the majority of the months, which was the granular consideration in the analysis. The separation between failed and successful seems similar, except for the summer months, when we can observe a peak in May, the great outlier and then a regression to the mean until a readjustment is experienced in September.
There are indications that the amount of successfull campaigns increases by the sheer amount of campaigns that start in the summer months, other non related considerations may increase the success rate, but as the volumes retreat the success rate falls as the failed numbers keeps a similar volume unrelated to the total attempts.
Our findings indicate that with a 66.9% success rate in May, this is the best chance to have succesful crowdfunding campaign.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
We can identify there is a significantly high percentage of plays with succesful funding when the goal is under $10,000; with many plays even exceeding their goal in funds pledged. At the same time we see how the success percentage reduces when over the $10,000 and it is minimal in the integer count when the goal is over $25,000 with some ranges having the success count in the single digits.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
 A major difficulty was to get the correct information for the charts so they reflected exactly what was required by Louise. We overcame this by getting in contact with classmates who gracefully worked along to obtain the exact code that would work for that purpose.
 
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The month that shows the most possitive separation of successful and failed is May, this means there were more successful campaigns started in May in total volume and in relation to the faild campaign started that month with a 2.13 to 1 ratio. 

December is evidently the worst month to launch a campaign, not only because of the lowest volume, wich is logical considering in this month there are the fewest campaigns launched overall, but because we observe almost as many failed campaigns as those that are successful.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The clear conclusion in regards of the goal based outcome is that a sensible threshold for a crowdfunding campaign pertinent to a theater play is $20,000. The success rate dramatically raises after this number and as the  goal increases we see the total volume of attempts minimize. It is clear than a budget in the $5,000 to $15,000 range is the more sensible when considering crowdfunding.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
There is not a lot of depth in the data, there are other consdierations that coudld come in play when analyzing the potential success of campaigns, like demographics on the backers, distribution of budget and possible return of investment. With the dataset given, we have to work with assumptions and take many of these considerations as equal, when we know they are not.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We experimented with Whisker and Box graphs, which I consider interesting in making a distribution of the entries and identifying outliers, also identify trends with other types of line, bar charts and see the distribution of backers with Pareto charts if that information was available.
